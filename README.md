# Airline Passenger Forecasting with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project uses deep learning techniques to forecast airline passenger traffic based on historical data. The goal is to predict the number of passengers in the upcoming months using different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Airline Passengers dataset** which consists of monthly total international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

### Models Used
- Simple RNN
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Conv1D
- Bidirectional LSTM

Each model was trained on the same dataset.

## Results
Here we compare the actual and predicted values for each model.

## Conclusion
The Bidirectional LSTM model performed the best in forecasting passenger traffic due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.
